###What problems does PoshDevOps attempt to solve?

Build/Deployment services today are extremely powerfull and easy to use. However, if you throw your DevOps together in most of these services you are left with: 
######-1 lack of versioning side by side source code 
######-2 coupling of implementation to a proprietary build/deployment service.
######-3 no capability to run outside of a proprietary build/deployment
######-4 expenses (subscriptions, licenses, hardware,  etc...)
######-5 one off scripts lacking modularity/reusability

###How does PoshDevOps attempt to solve them?
######+1 versioning side by side source code
######+2 implemented as plain old PowerShell modules
######+3 ability to run anything capable of running PowerShell
######+4 no expenses (as long as you have something capable of running PowerShell ;))
######+5 all tasks are implemented as PowerShell modules and packaged as .nupkg files

###How do I install it?
Make sure you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed, then from PowerShell run
```POWERSHELL
choco install poshdevops -version 0.0.65; # 0.0.65 was latest at time of writing
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\PoshDevOps\Modules\PoshDevOps" -Force
```
###In a nutshell, hows it work?
***Conceptually:***
- A `DevOp` (development operation) is set of related tasks
  for example: "Build", "Unit Test", "Package", "Deploy", "Integration Test", .. etc
- `tasks` are arbitrary operations implemented as PowerShell modules and packaged as .nupkg's.    
  for example: a "Package Artifacts" DevOp might have tasks: Copy Artifacts To Temp, Create NuGet Package

***Operationally:***
- everything takes place within PowerShell
- as you create/edit your `DevOps` a snapshot of each is maintained in a `YOUR-DEVOP-NAME.psd1` file (under the .PoshDevOps directory).

###How do I get started?
navigate to the root directory of your project:
```POWERSHELL
Set-Location "PATH-TO-ROOT-DIR-OF-YOUR-PROJECT"
```
create a new DevOp:
```POWERSHELL
New-DevOp -Name Build
```
add a few tasks to your DevOp:
```POWERSHELL
Add-DevOpTask -DevOpName Build -Name "Restore NuGet Packages" -PackageId RestoreNuGetPackages
Add-DevOpTask -DevOpName Build -Name "Build Visual Studio Sln" -PackageId BuildVisualStudioSln
Add-DevOpTask -DevOpName Build -Name "Execute Unit Tests" -PackageId "InvokeVSTestConsole"
Add-DevOpTask -DevOpName Build -Name "Create NuGet Package" -PackageId "CreateNuGetPackage"
```
invoke your DevOp:
```POWERSHELL
@{"Create NuGet Package"=@{Version="0.0.1";OutputDirectoryPath=.}} | Invoke-DevOp -Name Build
```

###How do I distribute my DevOps?
When you invoke `New-DevOp` for the first time it creates a folder named `.PoshDevOps` at the root of your project. Make sure you add this directory to version control and you're done. 

pro-tip: exclude the `.PoshDevops\packages` folder from version control. PoshDevOps is smart enough to handle re-downloading any DevOp packages when it needs them and this way you don't bloat your version control.
