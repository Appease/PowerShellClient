**What is it?**
A PowerShell task runner based on [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

**Why Is It Based On Grunt?**
Why reinvent the wheel when it's already bad-ass... one less framework to grasp... learn one, understand both... need i continue?

**How do I use it?**
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Add a `Gruntfile.ps1` to the root directory of your project.
3. Add a [Packages.config](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall#packagesconfig---v09813).

**How do I Install it?**
The easiest way to install is by using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/posh-grunt).
```
cinst posh-grunt
```

**Where's the Documentation?**
