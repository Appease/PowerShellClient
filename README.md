###What problems does PoshDevOps attempt to solve?

Build/Deployment services today are extremely powerfull and easy to use. However, if you throw your task group together in most of these services you are left with: 
######-1 lack of task group versioning side by side with source code 
######-2 coupling of your task group implementation to a proprietary build/deployment service.
######-3 no capability to run your task group outside of a proprietary build/deployment service
######-4 expenses (subscriptions, licenses, hardware,  etc...)
######-5 one off scripts lacking any any sort of modularity
######-6 rampant copying/pasting, general lack of reuse amongst task group components

###How does PoshDevOps attempt to solve them?
######+1 task group versioning side by side with source code
######+2 task group implemented as plain old PowerShell modules
######+3 ability to run your task group on anything capable of running PowerShell
######+4 no expenses (as long as you have something capable of running PowerShell ;))
######+5 all tasks are implemented as PowerShell modules
######+6 all tasks are package based and inherently reuseable

###How do I install it?
Make sure you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed, then from PowerShell run
```POWERSHELL
choco install poshdevops -version 0.0.11; # 0.0.11 was latest at time of writing
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\PoshDevOps\Modules\PoshDevOps" -Force
```
###In a nutshell, hows it work?
***Conceptually:***
- `task groups` contain an ordered set of tasks
- `tasks` are arbitrary tasks which are implemented as PowerShell modules and packaged as .nupkg's.

***Operationally:***
- everything takes place within PowerShell
- as you [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) your `task group` a snapshot is maintained in a `TaskGroup.psd1` file.
- at any time you can invoke your `task group` and pass in any variables your `tasks` rely on

###How do I get started?
navigate to the root directory of your project:
```POWERSHELL
Set-Location "PATH-TO-ROOT-DIR-OF-YOUR-PROJECT"
```
create a new task group:
```POWERSHELL
New-PoshDevOpsTaskGroup
```
add a task to your plan:
```POWERSHELL
Add-PoshDevOpsTask -Name "Compile" -ModulePath "PATH-TO-DIR-CONTAINING-MODULE"
```
invoke your task group:
```POWERSHELL
@{Compile=@{Var1='Value1';Var2='Value2'}} | Invoke-PoshDevOpsTaskGroup
```

###How do I distribute my task group?
When you run `New-PoshDevOpsTaskGroup` it creates a folder named `.PoshDevOps` at the root of your project. From then on all modifications to your task group are maintained inside that folder so your .PoshDevOps folder is all you need!

(pro-tip: check your .PoshDevOps folder in to source control to version your task group along with your code.)
